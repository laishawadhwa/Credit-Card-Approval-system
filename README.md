# Credit-Card-Approval-system
A Machine Learning approach to automate credit card approval in banks . Winning solution for AMERICAN EXPRESS AIML hacakthon (Techgig Geek Goddesss 2019)

# Credit Card Approval
Predicting if credit card request will be approved for the customer given other attributes.

### Motivation
Banking industries received so many applications for credit card request. 
Going through each request manually can be very time consuming, 
also prone to human errors. However, if we can use the historical data to build a 
model which can shortlist the candidates for approval that can be great.

### Libraries Used
  - sklearn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib

To install the above packages using pip, use command
```$pip install package-name```


### Usage
  - Run the jupyter notebook CreditCardApproval_Amex.ipynb

### Summary
In this project, I have tried to find out the factors that are most important for getting an approval for the credit card by leveraging data analysis and Machine Learning. Though the accuracy achieved is 88.984%, I also tried to check if we can improve the performance further and tried grid searchCV and neural networks. However, 89% is the best I could get from this data using all the models. 

- Data Set: 590 data points for training. Further description in the notebook.
